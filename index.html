    <p>2017 was quite the year for women in the media.
    Fuelled by the Harvey Weinstein scandal that shook Holywood to its core in early October,
    the international press suddenly began devoting an unprecedented level of column inches to reports of sexual harassment
    and abuses of power along gender lines.
    </p>
    <p>Since October, the aftershocks of the Weinstein scandal have been felt across industry and continent.
    Here in the UK, many female journalists were encouraged to speak out about the harassment
    and discrimination they experience at work. Evening Standard columnist Ros Urwin went as far as to set up an organisation called The Second Source,
    the aim of which is to provide support to women in an industry still seen as being dominated by men.</p>
    <p>So what is it really like to be a woman in the British media in 2018?
    Are female journalists truly as underrepresented as many believe them to be and how have things changed in recent years?
    This article will attempt to contribute to these questions by analysing the gender of ten years of online bylines from
    one of the biggest newspapers in the country, the Guardian.

    <h4>Findings</h4>
    <p>A first glance at the data would perhaps prove disappointing for those who champion equality between the sexes.
    Since 2008 women have consistently received far less bylines than men on the Guardian website, ranging from a low of
    28 percent in 2010 and 2011, to a peak of 36 percent last year. Clearly disproportionate in a country where just over
    50 percent of the population are women. </p>
    <p>By delving into the byline data by section, we can see that one explanation for this disproportionality could be the
    lack of female bylines in the sport and football sections. Each year sport and football are consistently in the top four
    most written about sections of the Guardian website, yet women rarely make up as much as ten percent of authors. In 2016,
    for example, sport was the single most written about subject by the Guardian online, yet only five percent of article contributors
    were women. An interesting next step would be to analyse the data without the sport and football sections, to see how that
    impacted the overall gender balance. </p>
    <p>In saying that, there are few sections where women repeatedly make close to 50 percent of contributors. When analysing
    the data as a whole there are only two sections in the last ten years where women are writing more than men; life and style
    and money. Women are also well represented in the books, stage and society sections but less so in technology and film.
    </p>
    <p>While the data clearly shows that women are currently underrepresented in the bylines of the Guardian online,
    we can also view a trend towards equality. Since 2011, the percentage of female bylines has consistently risen each year,
    improving by ? points in a six year period. In fact, a quicky analysis of these results using a linear regression mode
    l would suggest that gender equality within the Guardian bylines will be reached by 2030.

    <h4>Methodology</h4>
    <p>Data was downloaded about all online Guardian articles, including section name and byline, from the Guardian API.
    The Guardian was chosen largely due to the ease of accessing this information but also because it is one of the most
    read online newspapers in the country. </p>
    <p>The data downloaded from the Guardian was then compared to a database of male and female names that can be found here.
    This database accounts for the genderless nature of certain names by assigning a probability rating as to whether a name
    is more likely to be male or female. However, as this list is based on the US rather than UK, a small proportion of names
    may be incorrectly assigned. </p>
    <p>Important to note is that the above data illustrates the number of authors, rather than the number of articles.
    If an article has more than one author in the bylines, which is a common occurrence,  then it will be counted multiple times.
    This data does therefore not provide information about the amount of articles being produced by the Guardian and shouldn’t be
    used to do so. </p>
    <p>The above chart also omits the number of authors categorised as unknown. Unknown authors can mean an article that does not
    have a byline or an article that was written by a generic author such as ‘The Guardian.’ Obviously it could also mean that the
    author’s name did not appear in the chosen database. </p>
